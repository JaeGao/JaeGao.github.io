        <h3>Scientific Name of the Creature:</h3>

        Vibravoluta Chromatica

        Discovered by (Scientistâ€™s Name) / at (Time of Discovery):
        Discovered by Dr. Luminosa in 2024 during a computational biodiversity exploration.

        <h3>Family:</h3>
        Electronica Fantasia - a unique family of digital organisms that exist within the computational ecosystems,
        thriving in virtual environments and simulations.

        <h3>Habitat:</h3>
        Vibravoluta Chromatica predominantly inhabit digital realms, particularly thriving in complex algorithmic
        landscapes that simulate real-world physics. Their primary ecosystem is the dynamic, code-based environment of
        the p5.js universe, where they interact with various shapes and objects defined by programming constructs.

        <h3>Appearance:</h3>
        These creatures exhibit a dazzling array of colors with a semi-transparent body that glows in the
        digital darkness. They have a simple, geometrical body shape that allows for swift movement across the screen.
        The colors of Vibravoluta Chromatica can range from hot pink to deep sky blue, often shimmering with a gradient
        that responds to their virtual surroundings.
        <h3>Key Characteristics:</h3>
        Adaptive Coloration: Their color changes in response to their environment and interactions, serving both as a
        means of communication and camouflage.
        Orbital Navigation: They move by applying forces upon themselves, navigating through digital space with an
        elegance that belies their simple form.
        Flocking Behavior: when they are close to each other, they tend to converge to similar flight patterns.
        Interaction with Shapes: They exhibit unique behaviors around different geometric shapes, demonstrating
        attraction and repulsion forces that guide their movement and survival strategies in their digital habitat.

        What do we know so far about the creature?
      </p>
      <p>
        Vibravoluta Chromatica are known for their complex social behaviors and their ability to interact with the
        digital environment in sophisticated ways. They communicate with one another through light patterns and navigate
        their world with a keen sense of the virtual physics that govern their existence.

        How do we interact with this creature?
      </p>
      <p>
        Human interaction with Vibravoluta Chromatica is primarily through the modification of their digital
        environment. By changing code parameters, introducing new shapes, or altering physical laws within their
        universe, we can observe how they adapt and respond. These interactions provide valuable insights into
        computational ecosystems and the potential for digital life forms.
        Sliders can affect their enviroments to change the amplitude of the orbit functions.
        You may show the creatures a bright light by clicking the with the mouse, but they don't seem to like it much.
        The creature will occasionally exhibit flocking behavior.
